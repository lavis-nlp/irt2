# keep at most n closed world mentions per relation (optional)
# this overwrites the 'target mention split' for all
# mentions whose mention count is larger)
target mention count: 800

# split all mentions by this ratio 0.6 means 60% of all mentions are
# moved to closed-world and 40% are moved to open-world
target mention split: 0.7

# of all the open-world mentions set aside the following amount
# of mentions for validation
target validation split: 0.2
