# mention sampling for closed/open-world split
# options: either 'uniform' or 'weighted reciprocal'
# where:
#   - uniform: separates closed and open-world without any assumptions
#     which may lead to underrepresented relations who are not used
#     as concept relations to not appear in the training data
#   - weighted reciprocal: draw mentions for the closed world with a
#     higher probability which participate in relations with a small
#     number of associated triples
#
sampling: weighted reciprocal
